# Fallout Terminal desktop with Rainmeter
Based on Daniel2435/mrcoaster's work on [here](http://mrcoaster.deviantart.com/art/Fallout-Terminal-1-1-2-576429409) and [here](https://redd.it/3vmvvp)

# Installation
* Install Rainmeter from [here](https://www.rainmeter.net/). Download [the .rmskin file](https://github.com/eyezis/Rainmeter-Fallout-Terminal/blob/master/Fallout%20Terminal%20v2_v1.0.3.rmskin?raw=true) from this repository and double click it.
* (optional) [Get the wallpaper here](https://i.imgur.com/b6yfmnE.png) (by /u/Daniel2435 on Reddit)
After the installation, you should edit Documents\Rainmeter\Skins\FalloutTerminalv2\@resources\Variables.inc.
The Variables.inc file that comes with the skin should be enough to learn how the menus work. I'll add some documentation to the wiki on this repository as people run into problems.

# Features
* Fully configurable infinitely leveled menus
* Easy to understand configuration files
* Regularly updated

# License
This skin is licensed under the [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/), basically do what you want with the code. Do not blame me or ask me for help if you break something by editing something you shouldn't normally edit.
